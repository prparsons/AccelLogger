# AccelLogger
Simple logging script for ICM-20948, as implemented by SparkFun https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15335

Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero, and a Pi 4.

This is a rather limited implementation...mainly trying to keep everything as fast as possible since this is done via a python script. No guarantees that I didn't misunderstand something in the documentation either!

The magnetometer is not implemented yet due to the lack of documentation (and I didn't have a need for it either).
